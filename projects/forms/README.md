# Forms Typed (ngx-forms-typed)
This project aims at providing several tools for Angular Forms development, including:
 - types for strongly typing your `FormControl`s, `FormGroup`s and `FormArray`s based on a Model type
 - functions for instantiating the `TypedFormControl`, `TypedFormGroup` and `TypedFormArray` based on a Model type
 - a helper function that enumerates all controls in a form (group)
     - calls methods on each of them
     - attaches their validators to a parent form (group)
     - attaches the touched/untouched behavior to a parent form (group)

## Getting started

1. `npm i ngx-forms-typed`
2. Create a model for your form (see [example](/src/app/person-contact/person-contact.model.ts))
3. Inherit `ControlValueAccessorConnector` (see [example](/src/app/person-contact/person-contact.component.ts))
4. Enjoy your type safety!
5. See **examples**:
    - Shallow - https://stackblitz.com/edit/forms-typed-example-shallow?file=src/app/app.component.html
    - Nested - https://stackblitz.com/edit/forms-typed-example-nested?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html

## Features

## Manually applying strong types to existing forms
![Manually typed example - value - missing image](./assets/manually-typed-value.png)

Example shows adding the strong type to an existing form control and its value is now **strong typed**!

![Manually typed example - missing image](./assets/manually-typed.jpg)
The controls property is now **strong typed**!

Note: The parameters for the `FormControl` are **not strong typed**. Notice we are passing the `t` as a FormControl and then are trying to access `email`. Hence the `typedFormGroup` function. See [below](#Using-the-helper-functions-to-strong-type-forms)

## Using the helper functions to strong type forms
![auto typed example - parameter error - missing image](./assets/typed-form-control-error.png)

Using the function, now the parameters passed in are also **strong typed**!

And the `setValue` (`patchValue` also) method(s)

And the status changed

## Using the helper function to touch all controls in a form
A function allowing easy and type-safe interacting with each form control in a form:
![For each control in - missing image](./assets/for-each-touched.png)
Will iterate over all controls in a form group or form array and call the `markAsTouched` method on them

Type safe:
![For each control in - missing image](./assets/for-each-typed.png)
Multiple methods as params supported:

### Interaction in parent-child form scenarios:
![For each control in - missing image](./assets/for-each-parent-child-interact.png)

Here we want the validation of the child `Address` form to influence the parent `Person` form. That's the `addValidatorsTo()` method's job. We also want to make the child form touched if we call the parent form `touch()` method. That's the `markAsTouchedSimultaneouslyWith()` method's job. For more details and how they interact see example implementation:
 - [parent component](src/app/party-form/party-form.component.ts)
 - [child form](src/app/person-contact/person-contact.component.ts)
 - [control value accessor connector](src/app/shared/control-value-accessor-connector.ts)

## ControlValueAccessorConnector (CVAC)

A component that does all the heavy lifting when implementing a custom `ControlValueAccessor`
- implement the required methods (`registerOnChange`, `registerOnTouched` `writeValue` and `setDisabledState`)
- expose itself as `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` to the form control
- make sure all the statuses are updated as needed up and down (from the parent down and from itself up)

Example - the constructor `super` and `ngOnInit` super calls are all that's needed:
```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'fty-event-form',
  templateUrl: './event-form.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./event-form.component.css']
})
export class EventFormComponent implements OnInit extends ControlValueAccessorConnector<
    EventForm,
    TypedControlsIn<EventForm>
  >
{
  constructor(@Optional() @Self() directive: NgControl) {
    super(
      directive,
      typedFormGroup({
        eventName: typedFormControl<string>(undefined, Validators.required),
        location: typedFormControl<string>(),
        dateStart: typedFormControl(defaultDateStart),
        timeStart: typedFormControl(defaultTimeStart)
      })
    );
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    super.ngOnInit();
  }
  onNameInputBlur() {
    this.onTouch();
  }
  onLocationInputBlur() {
    this.onTouch();
  }
  onStartDateInputBlur() {
    this.onTouch();
  }
  onStartTimeInputBlur() {
    this.onTouch();
  }
}
```


### Limitations of the CVAC
- It requires injecting NgControl. Like [so](https://github.com/gparlakov/forms-typed/blob/21e99c91877746b506dd64ad0e5a127eeed15bac/src/app/person-contact/person-contact.component.ts#L13)
- It requires calling super.ngOnInit from the child ngOnInit. Like [so](https://github.com/gparlakov/forms-typed/blob/21e99c91877746b506dd64ad0e5a127eeed15bac/src/app/person-contact/person-contact.component.ts#L24)
- At present .get('name') is not strongly typed - could be if users want it
- All properties of a model need to have corresponding controls in a FormGroup modeled with a type. That means that Typescript will yell at you if you don't give it a FormControl for each and every property in the model. It's a restriction that's there by design, although I can see how it would sadden someone reusing the model for other things and can break their forms.
- FormGroup inherited limitation: value on an enabled FormGroup would include only enabled fields in that FormGroup - which is what you may or may not want. See [source](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/forms/src/model.ts#L1570-L1579).
